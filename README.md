This is a module to read video files and play/display it using the JUCE 
framework (juce.com). The audio will be available as a juce::AudioSource and 
can be processed through a regular processing chain.

Find the [API documentation here](https://filmstro.github.io/filmstro_ffmpeg/)

Dependencies
============

The reading is done using ffMpeg (ffmpeg.org). You will have to build ffmpeg
and link your project to it, if it's not already installed. We use this flags:

OSX:

    ./configure --cc=CC --arch=x86_64 --disable-static --enable-shared --disable-stripping --disable-debug --install-name-dir='@loader_path'

Windows:

    ./configure --toolchain=msvc --disable-static --enable-shared --prefix=../build/windows --arch=x86 

To make

    make -j10
    make install

You can add an audio meter simply by adding the module https://github.com/ffAudio/ff_meters to the projucer project.


Current State
=============

It works for us with mp4 files. However, there are many formats that theoretically should work, but some create
problems, probably to do with the sequence of packets / frames in the stream. To
improve this any insights and findings are very welcome.

There is an example how to write e.g. an Animation to a file, see examples/AnimationWriter. The animation is
simply copied from the JUCE examples and the writer is added.

We hope it is of any use, let us know of any problems or improvements you may 
come up with...
